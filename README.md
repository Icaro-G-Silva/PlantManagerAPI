# Plant Manager API
> Plant Manager project by NLW5 but it's made by my way

## About the project
_Plant Manager_ is an app that helps you control your time and save yours plants' lives.

## How it works?
Basically, you have to _register_ your own plant in the app, and tell us _when_ it's better to start advise you to _take care_ of your plants. <br>
Along the day, our job is to _assure_ you when is better for you to go _water your plants_ as like as _how much_ you have to.

## Ok, but this repo is an API only?
**Yes!**<br>
We thought it might be a good idea, because if you want to _create your own Frontend_, your own _Plant Manager version_, you can simply use _this_ API to _get_ and _fetch_ all the informations you going to need!

## Where I can read more about it?
> [Here in the Project's Wiki!](https://github.com/Icaro-G-Silva/PlantManagerAPI/wiki) <br>

All the documentation is going to be there! so, _smarten up_!
